# Chatroom-REACT
A Full-stack website that allows users to create messages between users. Users have many options such as changing themes, profile settings and more. \
This website also has an AI chatbot that creates a chat with the current user upon registering. It can reply, comment and do many things with the current user. \
There are still minor bugs that will be worked out.
